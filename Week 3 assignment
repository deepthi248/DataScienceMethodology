EHR - Electronic Health Records

1.Analytic Approach:
The analytic approach for the problem statement is "Classification" and "decision tree".
predicting the disease based on EHR - "decision tree"
For classifying of disease according to the symptoms is "classification approach"

2.Data Requirement:
EHR data of patients with Disease-specific labeling.

The EHR data of patients who visited doctors is required.
The data should contain the following data
Patient Name,  
Date, 
Time of consultation, 
Symptoms,  
prescribed diagnosis,
The criticality of Condition,  
Pharmacy Prescriptions, etc.


Data Collection:
The EHR data is collected from different hospitals, clinics and online consultations. 
EHR data should be collected from the patient's first to the recent consultation, 
the data should be accurate as the data is very sensitive. Many diseases have similar 
symptoms which may differ in severity, timings, age of the patient, etc. The data collected 
should cover different cases with the same disease among different age groups,symptoms, etc.

4.Data Understanding and Preparation:
The person should have a clear understanding of the business problem, 
data collection and should take steps towards data preparation accordingly. 
The data collected should represent a business problem. The data collected 
should be related to diseases, symptoms, and diagnostics. The data collected 
should be named under proper formats with user-friendly labels and should 
have a text file describing the labels of the data collected for better understanding. 
A statistical analysis that includes measuring mean, median, standard deviation,
correlation of feature should be carried out on different features available in the dataset, 
visualization of data in different graphs helps in understanding the diversity of the data set. 
In our case study, the graphs help us in understanding the data collected in different age groups,
symptoms, and diseases. Once a person understands the data well, the next step is data preparation. 
The data collected might generally have a few common problems like having null or NA values, 
missing values, duplicate values and checking the format of the data. These must be dealt with 
before moving before drawing insights into the data collected. Once the basic problems mentioned 
above are eliminated, further steps can be performed on the data like feature extraction,
dimensionality reduction. etc, These steps help us to eliminate the features of the data which is the
least priority and boosts the accuracy and efficiency of the analysis.
